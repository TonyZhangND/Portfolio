# Portfolio

Being a recreational trader on Robinhood, I lacked the tool to visualize 
my allocation for each stock that I owned. Thus, I decided to write this tiny toy 
program to do just that. 

Stock quotes are pulled using the Alphavantage API.

## Usage

- alphavantage.key -- Place your Alphavantage key in this plain text file
- positions.csv -- Input to the program the postions that you own
- portfolio.csv -- Output of the program
